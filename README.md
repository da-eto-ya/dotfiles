dotfiles
========

Simple .dotfiles configuration with [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/) as manager.

For Vim: [http://vim.spf13.com/](http://vim.spf13.com/) used as main configuration.

TODO: install/update scripts for tools (+ bootstrap script to new machines, tested in clean VM).
